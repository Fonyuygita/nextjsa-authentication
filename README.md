- 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the database connection in the `.env` file
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage
1. Register a new user account or login with existing credentials
2. Access protected routes that require authentication
3. Perform CRUD operations on the data
4. Customize the application to fit your specific requirements

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB (or your preferred database)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
